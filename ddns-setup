## 🌐 Home Lab Remote Access Setup (DDNS + Port Forwarding)

This project documents the setup of a personal homelab server with secure remote access using Dynamic DNS, port forwarding, and firewall configuration.

### ✅ Summary of Completed Steps

- 🔧 Set up a homelab server using Ubuntu for remote management and future self-hosted projects.
- 🌍 Registered and configured a **No-IP Dynamic DNS (DDNS)** hostname: `mk-2003.ddns.net`.
- 🛠️ Created a DDNS key and linked it to the Verizon router to auto-update public IP changes.
- 📡 Configured the Verizon router to **forward external traffic** to internal **SSH port 22** on the homelab.
- 🧱 Reserved a **static local IP address** for the server to maintain consistent port forwarding.
- 🔐 Enabled **SSL mode** in the DDNS client for secure credential transmission.
- 🧪 Verified remote access functionality by SSHing into the server from an external network via mobile hotspot:
  ```bash
  ssh -p 22 username@mk-2003.ddns.net
